# CRYPTO_PUNKS_Project

## Presentation
Content
Team members have drafted their project, including the following:
### ✓ Selected topic: 
Explore the surging world of  NFT's, focused on a collection of 10.000 Crypto Punks as PNG images, to establish which features and attributes using Machine Learning determine the type of Crypto Punk such as [“Male', 'Female', 'Zombie'. 'Ape' or 'Alien'] or accessories [Glasses]. 

### ✓ Reason why they selected their topic: 
With this project we seek to apply our data analytics skills using Machine Learning while expanding our knowledge base by implementing an image classification model, as this is an increasingly relevant field in the use of Machine Learning.

### ✓ Description of their source of data: 
CryptoPunks were created by Larva Labs in 2017. They are the first NFT series to catch popular interest, and one of the most actively traded. The dataset consists of json file with all CryptoPunk transactions and the relevant attributes of the 10,000 CryptoPunks such as type [“Male', 'Female', 'Zombie'. 'Ape' or 'Alien'] and any of the 87 differets accessories [such as beard, glasses, hair, etc].

A second dataset cotains png image file for each of the 10,000 CryptoPunks NFT's.

### ✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data.

Our model should predict, given an image file, which type of CryptoPunks the image represents. [“Male', 'Female', 'Zombie'. 'Ape' or 'Alien']. 


## GitHub

## Main Branch 
### ✓ Includes a README.md

README.md README.md must include: 

### ✓ Description of the communication protocols

- The team has been in continue communication through slack. 
- Each member has been working in their own branch. 
- We divide task according to the different roles (triangle, circle, square).

## Machine Learning Model

In this project we choose to use a Convolutional and Neural Network model.

Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:

✓ Takes in data in from the provisional database 

✓ Outputs label(s) for input data

## Database

Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:

✓ Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 

✓ Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
